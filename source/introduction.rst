 
Introduction
============ 

This manual provides information about SECAR hardware and software, and contains standard operating procedures for various SECAR subsystems. I (K. Setoodehnia) do not have the time (and quite frankly the interest) to include the information presented here in FRIB DCC. If the existing DCC documents are in contradiction with this document, it is because they are out-dated, and I did not bother to review, correct and update them. You should trust the information given here over those provided in the DCC documents.
