Vacuum System
=============

This chapter describes what you need to know about SECAR's vacuum system.

Foreline Vacumm Systems and Rough Pumps
---------------------------------------

All of the scroll pumps of SECAR and their roughing valves are operated manually, and thus have no interlocks, which is very unfortunate. I asked the vacuum group to provide me a required budget to fix this issue but it would cost too much to correct this. 

Except the scroll pump of the target area, those of the two Wien filters, and the pump on the isobutane system of the ionization chamber, all other SECAR scroll pumps are Agilent IDP-15 dry oil free pumps. The scroll pumps of the target area and the two Wien filters are Edwards XDS35i dry pumps. The scroll pump for the isobutane system of the ionization chamber at focal plane 4 of SECAR is Edwards nXDS10i dry pump. All the scroll pumps require regular maintenance (change of their tip seal), which is described in :numref:`maintenance`.

The other unfortunate fact about SECAR's rough vacuum is that there is no pressure gauge on any of the roughing stations and the foreline vacuums anywhere except the target area and the two Wien filters. I have added pressure gauges to the Wien filters' rough vacuums although there is still no remote reading of these pressures and no interlocks on those manual valves. Figure :numref:`WF_rough` shows these systems. The target area also has various pressure gauges which can be read remotely. The rough vacuum of all the other sections can only be read when the part of the beamline is not under high vacuum! This is because there are no foreline gauges. 

All foreline gauges are actually attached to the high vacuum section of the beamline instead of the foreline and are separated by a totally useless manual valve! Therefore, these gauges are useless when the high vacuum pumps are ON. The low vacuum gauges are mostly Barathron gauges up to Wien filter 1 and Pirani gauges after Wien filter 1. The range for Barathron gauges was not picked properly either, so they will mostly only show around a minimum of 0.1 Torr, which makes it risky to pump down a beamline section properly. One would turn a turbo pump ON when the vacuum is 100 mTorr, which is too much, which is really annoying.

In any case, the subsections below describe how to vent and pump down a beamline section.

High Vacuum Pumps
-----------------

SECAR's high vacuum is obtained by Agilent TV 1001 turbo pumps up to Wien filter 1, and Pfeiffer Hipace 80 turbo pumps from Wien filter 1 up to the end. On each of the Wien filters, there is an Edwards turbo pump and a cryopump producing high vacuum. On the target section, we have screw pumps, Roots blower and Leybold turbo pumps.
